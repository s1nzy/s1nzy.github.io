#### PhD Candidate

=======

#### Summary

=======

Pharmacist with research experience in top-down (population analysis) and bottom-up (physiology-based) modeling approaches and their applicability in pediatric therapy and drug development. Project coordinator for a few BSc and MSc internships. Looking for opportunities to apply interdisciplinary approaches to solve the challenges of drug development at different stages.

#### Core Competencies

=======

  - Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics
  - Population PK & PBPK modeling and simulation
  - Clinical applicability of modeling results

#### Work experience

======

_Certara_		(2015)

Research Associate at Simcyp (Sheffield, UK)

Contributed to the development of the skin PBPK model (V15). These results were presented at local symposia. I evaluated features of the absorption PBPK modules of the Simcyp software.

_Center for Human Drug Research (CHDR)_		(2014)

Master’s Intern (Leiden, NL)

Learned the basics of population modeling and developed PK/PD models for three antipsychotics and their effect on plasma prolactin levels. I learned effective data management and how to make a pharmacometric analysis plan and report according to the company’s internal guidelines.

_Leiden Academic Center For Drug Research (LACDR)_ 		(2013 - 2014)

Master’s Intern (Leiden, NL)

Helped to optimize analytical methods used to measure drugs in rat plasma with U(H)PLC – MS/MS systems and ELISA kits. I identified drug-response patterns during a preliminary data analysis. Additionally, I learned how to write Standard Operating Procedures.
